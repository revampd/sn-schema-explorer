# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Hardening and tooling pass addressing a full repository audit ([#50](https://github.com/revampd/sn-schema-explorer/issues/50)).

### ⚠ Breaking

- **Node extractor no longer accepts credentials as command-line arguments.**
  Passing `--password` or `--apikey` now exits with an error. Provide secrets via
  the `SN_PASSWORD` / `SN_APIKEY` environment variables instead — command-line
  arguments leak into shell history and process listings.

### Added

- ESLint (flat config) and Prettier configuration, plus `lint`, `format`,
  `format:check`, and `test:coverage` npm scripts.
- Code-coverage reporting (vitest v8) with a ratcheted CI threshold.
- CI: lint job, `npm audit`, and a Node `[20, 22, 24]` test matrix; the release
  workflow now runs lint + unit + build + e2e before publishing.
- Unit tests for the Node extractor, the shared graph index builder, and filter
  memoisation; e2e tests for export formats, Path Finder, and Schema Diff.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `.editorconfig`.

### Changed

- `package.json` now declares `engines.node >= 20` (required by the dev
  toolchain; the standalone exporter artifact still runs on Node 18+).

### Fixed

- Node extractor: pagination now has a safety cap (no infinite loop on
  misbehaving/duplicate pages) and HTTP responses are size-capped to avoid heap
  exhaustion.
- Background script: user-supplied record-count regex patterns are compiled
  defensively (an invalid pattern is skipped with a warning instead of aborting
  the export).
- Background script: `sys_dictionary` is now queried with `active!=false` to
  match the Node extractor, so both exporters return the same row set.
- Viewer: shared `buildIndexes()` with normalized edge `_sourceId`/`_targetId`
  (removing duplicated index logic), memoised `filterOk`, and `localStorage`
  write failures now warn instead of failing silently.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- `--format` and `--edge-types` flags for the Node.js extractor.

### Changed

- Documentation updates: single build target, corrected commands, new features.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-22

Initial public release.

- Force-directed Schema Map with adjustable hop depth, max nodes, and edge-type
  filters; advanced filter builder.
- Inspector for fields, inheritance, references, M2M, and CMDB CI topology.
- Search by table or field name; Path Finder; Schema Diff; Saved Views.
- Export as PNG, SVG, JSON, Markdown, JSON-LD, OWL/Turtle, or OpenAPI YAML.
- Background Script and Node.js schema extractors.
